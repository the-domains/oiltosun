The intent of this site is to capture my ramblings about energy, technology and politics. By no means am I an expert in all of these fields. Who I am is an Electrician, Automation Tech, Automation lover, Energy dreamer, a dad, husband and son. I'm a regular Joe that loves everything to do with our connected world and the IoT (Internet of Things). 

I will use this site as a collection of my thoughts and findings online and in the real world that interest me. 

Disclaimer: I've been working in the Oil & Gas equipment manufacturing and support industry for the last 18 years. 

The disclaimer above does not mean that I am jaded and brainwashed to only accept Oil & Gas as the energy source of the future. I am in fact interested in net zero homes, electric cars and new forms of power generation. 

I look forward to updating here often, share, reach out and look forward to hearing from you! (I will also chat about thegrid.io which is how this site is hosted)
