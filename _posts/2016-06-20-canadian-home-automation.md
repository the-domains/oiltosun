The internal debate raging in my skull about which Smart Home platform is right for me continues......
![SmartThings initial home kit](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/49de560a-6e37-4ed2-87e9-be2854c57875.png)

These 2 platforms seem to be my only hope. I'm sure there's a bunch people out there that may point me in 10 other directions however this is what I'm looking at doing right now: 

Currently in my home:

1. **[][0]**[**Ecobee**][0]

2. **[][1]**

[**Chamberlain MyQ**][1]

Looking to add immediately:

1. I am looking to add lighting control to 3 of my outside lights (Neutral dependent)

2. Leak sensors

Eventually I'll add:

1. Security (open/close sensors)

2. Remotely controlled door locks

3. Webcam

One of the main reasons for looking into a hub is that I currently have the Ecobee and the MyQ system, both of which have their own native apps. The benefit of using a hub is that all these devices fall under the same umbrella allowing me to control both of those devices and anything else I add to the mix. Additional features allow me to create "recipes" or small programs in an If This Then That style. Which leads me to one of my additional criteria, [IFTTT][2] integration. Both [Wink][3] and [SmartThings][4] integrate with [IFTTT][2] which adds huge features as I'll eventually review in a future post. 

****Budget****

It's a tough world paying with Canadian Dollars, with the current exchange rate hovering around 0.709 we're getting smashed up here when it comes to online ordering. These are the days that I wish we either had a North American currency.....without all of the impending issues that would affect.
